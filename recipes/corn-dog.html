    <h3>This Recipe will help you prepare the best Corn Dog ever with very simple ingredients and instructions</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cornmeal and flour</strong>: This corn dog batter starts with yellow cornmeal and all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: A pinch of sugar lends a hint of sweetness.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking powder</strong>: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the batter rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt and pepper</strong>: Salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Milk</strong>: A cup of milk adds moisture, ensuring a tender coating.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg</strong>: An egg gives the batter even more moisture and acts as a binder, which means it helps hold the batter together.</li>
        <li><strong>Oil</strong>: Fry the corn dogs in a neutral oil with a high smoke point, such as vegetable oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Beef frankfurters</strong>: This recipe calls for beef frankfurters, but you can use pork franks (or hot dogs) if you'd prefer.</li>
